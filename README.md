Some notes on python - 2024 style


## Lecture summary

In this hands-on lecture on the Python Ecosystem we will assume you
are already (somewhat) familiar with python. Ideally you will already
have a python environment on your laptop, so you can play along with
the examples, but this is not required.

We will cover

* ipython (briefly)
* the spyder GUI
* Jupyter Notebooks, both running local and remote
* VS Code (if time permits)


A github repo https://github.com/astroumd/python2024 will be available
with example codes covered in the lecture.  This repo also contains
the install_anaconda3 script, to simplify installation on various unix
flavors. You can also head over to https://www.anaconda.com/ and do it
yourself.
